# splixIo-ProtocolLib
# VERY INCOMPLETE


A sort of library for interacting with splix.io's protocol at a *slightly* higher level

This library is only meant to be require()'d in it's current state, so it is recommended to include it as a git submodule. 

Currently very incomplete, this file will hopefully contain documentation when I feel this is complete enough. 

Current state as of May 11, 2019: Gameplay starts(skin stops stuff from working, so don't use that), can move around, changing direction sends user back to main spawn point(intended by me).
