# splixIo-ProtocolLib
# VERY INCOMPLETE; basically useless right now


A sort of library for interacting with splix.io's protocol at a *slightly* higher level

This library is only meant to be require()'d in it's current state, so it is recommended to include it as a git submodule. `example.js` will eventually become something close to a clone of Splix's servers. 

Currently very incomplete, this file will hopefully contain documentation when I feel this is complete enough. 

Current state as of May 11, 2019: Gameplay starts(skin stops stuff from working, so don't use that), can move around, changing direction sends user back to main spawn point(intended by me). 

If you're willing to actually run this, there is a Chrome extension in splixio-customserver/splixIo-Utilities that redirects the server ip to localhost:8000(when it works)
