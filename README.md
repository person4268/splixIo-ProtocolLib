# splixIo-ProtocolLib
A sort of library for interacting with splix.io's protocol at a *slightly* higher level

This library is NOT meant to be used as an `npm` package, it is intended to be used as a git submodule. 

Currently very incomplete, this file will hopefully contain documentation when I feel this is complete enough.
