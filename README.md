# splixIo-ProtocolLib
A sort of library for interacting with splix.io's protocol at a *slightly* higher level

Currently very incomplete, this file will hopefully contain documentation when I feel this is complete enough. Currently it doesn't have much in the way of things and is a very inactive side project of mine, but it might eventually be done, or might end up as a stepping stone for someone else.
